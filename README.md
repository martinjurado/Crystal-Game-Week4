# Crystal-Game-Week4

The Simpsons-themed crystal game. 

There will be four donuts displayed as buttons on the page on the bottom part of the application. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. Match the random number as you click on the donuts. This game automatically resets once you win or lose. This game was developed through the use of jQuery and JavaScript.
